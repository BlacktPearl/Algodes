INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS

project: 

A more basic yet fun project could be creating a "Anime Convention Schedule Planner" using a greedy algorithm!

### Idea:
You're attending an anime convention where multiple events (like panels, screenings, and meet-and-greets) happen simultaneously, and you want to attend as many as possible. Each event has a start and end time, and your goal is to maximize the number of events you can attend without overlap.

### How the Greedy Algorithm Works:
1. Sort the events based on their end time.
2. Start by selecting the event that ends the earliest.
3. Then, for each remaining event, pick the next one that starts after the current event finishes.
4. Repeat this until you've scheduled as many events as possible without conflicts.

### Why it's fun:
- You could add anime-themed events, like voice actor panels, screenings of popular anime episodes, or cosplay contests.
- You can make it visually engaging by representing the schedule as a timeline, or even using popular anime characters as placeholders for events.
- You could even add some randomization where the user inputs their favorite anime genres, and the algorithm suggests a personalized schedule of relevant events!

This project is simple but allows for creativity and can teach you how greedy algorithms can be applied to real-world scenarios like scheduling or time management.
