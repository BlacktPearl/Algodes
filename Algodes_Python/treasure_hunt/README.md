# Treasure Hunt - Closest Pair Algorithm Visualization

This interactive game demonstrates the Divide and Conquer algorithm for finding the closest pair of points in a 2D plane. The algorithm has an efficient O(n log n) time complexity, compared to the naive O(nÂ²) approach.

## Algorithm Overview

The Divide and Conquer approach for finding the closest pair works as follows:

1. Sort points by x-coordinate
2. Divide points into two halves
3. Recursively find closest pairs in each half
4. Find closest pair that crosses the dividing line
5. Return the minimum of all found distances

### Key Concepts Visualized

- **Divide**: The game shows how the plane is divided vertically into regions
- **Conquer**: Each sub-region's closest pair is highlighted
- **Combine**: The algorithm checks points near the dividing line
- **Efficiency**: Visual comparison with brute force approach

## How to Play
